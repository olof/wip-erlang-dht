This is not a working implementation of a DHT client. Yet..., and maybe never
will be.

The purpose of this project is to implement a Kademlia client/node in Erlang,
suitable for use with Mainline DHT, but with enough flexibility to be able to
use it with other similar Kademlia based DHTs.

(also, learning erlang, so probably disregard this repository completely.)
